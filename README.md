**Python Version:** 3.9  

**Libraries Used:** Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Sklearn, Statsmodels.api.

## Goals of this project:
    1. find some open data and import it to a dataframe
    2. explore the data, examine it for missing values, why are they missing?, how can this be solved?
    3. find what to model and see whether it seems like a realistic relationship
    4. create some features that can assist in the prediction of the model 
        -- is there any categorical data that would make a suitable dummy variable?
        -- is there any data that could be used as an instrumental variable?
    5. Begin modeling
    6. Evaluate the model

Looking at the finished project and the goals set for it, I completed all of them. I set low goals since this was the first end-to-end project I underwent and didn't want to fall into the trap of trying to do everything in one project.

I learned the dos and don't of larger datasets. This is one of the largest datatsets I have engaged with and the process time of some of the original cells made this evident.

I learned how to select data from very large datasets using slices and groupby

There were some issues with my installation that surfaced during this project, namely, python ran out of ram since I was using the 32-bit version of python unknowingly, so I had to reinstall is using the 64-bit version.
